Implementation Covered

1. Listen GET request only.
2. Fetch contents of directory
3. Display contents on UI
4. Navigation from parent to child and vice versa.
5. Allowing user to change port number and/or root directory.


Missing Pieces:
1. Integration Test cases
2. Response header attributes needs to be improved.
3. Missing checkstyle configuration
4. Used only few Http Response type
5. Mistakenly used HTTP/1.0


Design
------

HttpServerApplication is an entry point
        |
HttpServer (Controller Layer) -> The controller is responsible for processing request and sending response back to client.
        |
RequestResponseProcessor (Service Layer) -> The service is responsible for extracting request information from InputStream
        |                                   and fill it in HttpRequest object. Also, fetch the list of files from requested
        |                                   location. Prepare response data and send it back to client. This class also validates request data.
        |
        | - >    RequestValidator -> validates request content.
        | - >    ResponseTemplate -> templates to generate response data based on request type.
                    | - >     ResponseBuilder -> Contains all valid response content.
        | - >    Context -> Stores HttpRequest and HttpResponse object
                    | - >    HttpRequest -> Bean class for http request.
                    | - >    HttpResponse -> Bean class for http response.
        | - >    ApplicationProperties -> Store application properties. Such as port number, rootDirectory etc.

Other Independent Classes:

Constants -> Store constants, some of the constants can be moved to application.properties file as well
DateUtils -> Format date object/or convert from long milliseconds to formatted date.
FileUtils -> File related utilities
RequestMethod -> Request Method value such as GET. This can be used later on for other method types.
ResponseCode -> Store Http Response code and string.
InvalidRequestException -> Custom exception.
